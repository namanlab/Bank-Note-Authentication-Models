# Bank-Note-Authentication-Models
Used the Bank Note Authentication UCI data set to build models for identifying fake banknotes. Applied supervised classification and deep learning algorithms for building the models. Achieved an accuracy of 99% by creating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of 2 hidden layers with 6 neurons each (ReLU activation function, Adam optimizer).
